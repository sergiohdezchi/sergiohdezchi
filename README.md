### 🚀 About Me

I'm a Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on building reliable, scalable, and maintainable web applications.  
I enjoy working with technologies like:

- 🛠️ **Ruby on Rails** – for backend APIs and business logic  
- ⚛️ **React** – for creating responsive and dynamic UIs  
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – for fast, clean, and customizable designs  
- ☕ **Java** – for enterprise-level systems and API development  
- 🍃 **MongoDB** – for flexible NoSQL data modeling  
- 🐳 **Docker** & **PostgreSQL** – for smooth development and deployment  
- 📦 **Redis**, **Sidekiq**, **Karafka** – for background jobs and event-driven systems  

I love learning new things, solving problems, and collaborating with others to create meaningful digital products.
